However, some people in the open-source community have been able to harness it, and building upon it, our development team has been able to add to the existing knowledge base.\r\n\r\nThis project is an attempt to unify the community's knowledge and build an extensive documentation for iTunesMobileDevice.dll.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
