# iTunesMobileDevice-Documentation
An attempt to create the much-needed documentation for iTunesMobileDevice.dll.

#iTunesMobileDevice Community Documentation

### Welcome to ExaPhaser's community-oriented project to try to document iTunesMobileDevice.dll from the knowledge of the software community.

Since iTunesMobileDevice is maintained by Apple and is a proprietary part of iTunes, it has no documentation provided. However, some people in the open-source community have been able to harness it, and building upon it, our development team has been able to add to the existing knowledge base.

This project is an attempt to unify the community's knowledge and build an extensive documentation for iTunesMobileDevice.dll.
